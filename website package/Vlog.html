				The Pikes Peak Hill Climb is one of the most challenging automotive events in the world. With no guardrails 
				and unpredictable weather conditions, the course climbs 4,708 feet and includes 156 turns
			</p>
			<p>
				Rhys Millen, of Huntington Beach, Calif., drove the UPRD Nissan Skyline GT-R to victory in the high 
				performance showroom stock division at the 1999 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb near Colorado 
				Springs, Colo. on July 4. In the 12.42-mile sprint to the top of the 14,110-foot Pikes Peak summit, 
				Millen set a new class-record with a time of 12:13.47, beating David Donner in a Subaru Impreza, and 
				five-time hill climb winner Jeff Zwart in a Porsche Turbo S.
			</p>
			<p>
				Under Pressure Research &amp; Development (UPRD), of Huntington Beach, Calif., managed the team and prepared 
				the Nissan Skyline GT-R for the rigorous course in less than a month. MotoRex of Torrance, Calif, imports 
				the Skyline GT-R from Japan. Except for B.F. Goodrich racing tires, a new exhaust system, and safety 
				equipment, the Skyline that Millen raced to victory at Pikes Peak is the same as the one sold by MotoRex.

			<h4>24 Hours of Le Mans</h4>
			<p>
				In the 1980s Nissan embarked on an international sports car racing campaign. Purpose built prototype racers 
				were deployed in the popular World Sportscar Championship for Group C cars and the similar American IMSA GTP 
				championship. Several major victories were scored and a Nissan set the pole during the 1990 24 Hours of Le Mans 
				race. Drastic rule changes left all of Nissan's racing cars obsolete by 1994, but unlike most other manufacturers 
				Nissan did not pack up and instead set about developing a brand new car.
			</p>
			<p>
				The new regulations all but abolished prototype racers and clearly favoured production based GT cars. Nissan 
				decided to base their new 'GT1' racing car on the latest generation of the popular Skyline GT-R, known internally 
				as the 'R33'. In the previous seasons the 'R32' had completely dominated the local Japanese touring car championship 
				and also recorded a variety of impressive results in international events. To adapt the Skyline to the specific 
				requirements of racing at Le Mans, Nissan commissioned in-house experts NISMO to turn the high-tech road car into 
				a full-bore racing car.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even though the new regulations required a GT1 racing car to be based on a road car, production of just one 
				road car was sufficient to homologate the model. So while the R33 Skyline formed the basis of the project, NISMO 
				had full freedom as long as they built at least one similar road car. The end result was the R33 GT-R LM, which 
				looked similar to the production cars, but under the heavily body-kitted skin was quite heavily modified. The 
				biggest difference was the switch to rear wheel drive, abandoning the high-tech adaptive four wheel drive system 
				of the road car.
			</p>
			<p>
				Weighing in at 1150 kg and with 400 bhp on tap, two NISMO entered R33 GT-R LMs lined up for the 1995 edition of the 
				24 Hours of Le Mans. In the classic endurance race the two Nissans faced off against the McLaren F1 and Ferrari F40, 
				which dominated the GT1 class for pace. Despite qualifying in a lowly 34th position, the #22 GT-R LM gradually climbed 
				up the leaderboard and eventually finished the race in tenth overall and fifth in class, behind four McLarens. The 
				slightly faster #23 machine was not so fortunate as it was forced to retire with gearbox damage after 157 laps.
			</p>
			<p>
				Encouraged by the top ten finish, NISMO returned to Japan and further modified the two racing cars. The six cylinder 
				engine was slightly enlarged, lifting power to an impressive 600 bhp. Needless to say, the two GT-Rs were noticeably 
				faster during the 1996 edition, but the competition had increased as well with the likes of Porsche fielding purpose 
				built racing cars in the GT1 class. The #22 car lasted just over 209 laps and then had to retire with accident damage. 
				The sister car completed 307 laps (8 more than the 1995 outright winner) and finished 15th overall and 10th in class.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite the commendable performances of the GT-R LM, the program was pulled after two years into the three year program. 
				It had been well off the pace of the purpose built Porsche 911 GT1; a drastically different machine was required to 
				bridge that gap. Nissan followed in Porsche's footsteps and developed the V8-engined R390 for the 1997 Le Mans race. 
				The two NISMO built GT-R LMs were not raced after 1996, but Nissan did market a special 'LM Limited' edition of 
				the R33 road car, which was available in blue only.

			<h4>Speed World Challenge GT series</h4>
			<p>
				This is the first and only Nissan Skyline GT-R to have been raced in the United States in a professional road-race series.
			</p>
			<p>
				The car was originally raced in the Japanese Super Taikyu series, built by NISMO. Only about 12 were built, and who knows 
				how many remain. However, the spec in the Super Taikyu series was rather low for World Challenge GT, so in 2005 we proceeded 
				to upgrade the GT-R. All bodywork was changed to carbon/fiberglass to lose weight, the transmission changed to a Holinger 
				6-speed sequential, a triple plate carbon clutch was custom-made by Tilton to ensure successful standing-start launches. 
				All windows were changed to Lexan. In all, we were able to trim the weight of the GT-R down to under 3050 lbs dry - over 
				200 lbs shaved off the Super Taikyu-spec. Note that this is a weight that an R35 GT-R could never be in an AWD trim.
			</p>
			<p>
				To run the 305-width rubber on the car, Rays Engineering/Mackin Industries were kind enough to custom make light-weight 18x11J 
				width Volk TE37s in Japan specifically for this project.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2005 testing, we quickly learned that the stresses applied to the car on 305/35/18 Toyo Proxes RA1 tires were severely more 
				than the Super Taikyu-spec 250-width slicks, prompting us to find solutions to hub/bearing failures. Mr. Tetsuo Suzuki, the crew 
				chief of the Nurburgring 24-hr Falken GT-R team was introduced to us by NISMO to help us find solutions. The Nur GT-R also had 
				similar problems as it used 290-width slicks, so we followed their suit and upgraded the hubs to those used on the Nissan Cima 
				luxury vehicle.
			</p>
			<p>
				To comply with World Challgne GT safety regulations, we installed a custom NASCAR-style cage in addition to the FIA-certified cage 
				that was in place from the car's time in Japan.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a true one-of-a-kind Nissan Skyline GT-R racecar.

			<h4>Japanese Grand Touring Championship</h4>
			<p>
				The last time a factory backed Nissan Skyline GT-R would be seen in JGTC. 2003 saw a wave of new regulations unlock the ability 
				for Nissan to replace the factory front and rear structures of their GT500 Skyline GT-R with tubular space frame, meaning that 
				the cars became even wider, lower and faster than ever. With wider front tyres and the ability to fit a rear-mounted transaxle, 
				a very serious racing machine was born. The final hurrah for the chassis was a big one, winning the 2003 season thanks to incredible 
				consistency despite not actually claiming first place in a race.

			<h4>D1 Grand Prix</h4>
			<p>
				D1 Grand Prix is a production car drifting series from Japan. After several years of hosting amateur drifting contests, Daijiro Inada, founder 
				of Option magazine and Tokyo Auto Salon, and drifting legend, Keiichi Tsuchiya, hosted a professional level drifting contest in 
				1999 and 2000 to feed on the ever increasing skills of drifting drivers who were dominating drifting contests in various parts of 
				Japan. In October 2000, they reformed the contest as a five round series. In the following year for the following round, the 
				introduction of the two car tsuiou battle, run in a single-elimination tournament format, a common tradition for tōge races 
				which became popular with car enthusiasts.
