                Nobody really know where "Skyline" come from.  People suspect that it was related 
                to the famous Hakone Skyline Driveway.  This is a famous route that runs near Mount Fuji.
                This area is Skyline's real home.

        			<h4>Prince Skyline ALSI - 1 Series</h4>
        			<p>
        				The ALSI-1 series was built from 1957 until 1958 in sedan and station wagon bodystyles. It was powered 
        				by the 1.5-liter GA30 inline-4 engine producing 60 hp and reached a top speed of 80 mph (125 km/h).
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The front suspension was a double-wishbone and coil type, while the rear suspension was a De Dion and 
        				leaf spring type. The standard and deluxe models featured different grilles and side trim.
        			</p>
        			<h4>Prince Skyline ALSI - 2 Series</h4>
        			<p>
        				1958 saw the introduction of the ALSI-2 series, which was built until 1963. The car was basically the 
        				same as its predecessor, except for a different bonnet emblem and a single large horizontal bar in the grille.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				Also new were the quad headlights instead of the twin lamps featured in the ALSI-1 series and the upgraded 
        				1.5-liter GA4 engine with 70 hp.
        			</p>
        			<h4>Prince Skyline BLRA - 3 Series by Michelotti</h4>
        			<p>
        				1958 saw the introduction of the ALSI-2 series, which was built until 1963. The car was basically the same 
        				as its predecessor, except for a different bonnet emblem and a single large horizontal bar in the grille.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				Also new were the quad headlights instead of the twin lamps featured in the ALSI-1 series and the 
        				upgraded 1.5-liter GA4 engine with 70 hp.
        			</p>
        			<h4>Prince Skyline BLRA - 3 Series by Michelotti</h4>
        			<p>
        				1961 saw the production of the limited edition, hand-built Skyline Sport BLRA-3 series, designed by 
        				the Italian Michelotti. The car came in coupe and convertible bodystyles and shared its chassis with 
        				the Gloria. The 1.9-liter GB4 engine produced 94 hp and propelled the car to 95 mph (150 km/h).
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				This car was very beautifully designed, but on the other hand with a price tag of 1,850,000 yen very 
        				expensive for its time. So unfortunately it was dropped in favor of the following S 50-E series, 
        				which was cheaper to produce. Only 60 units were produced.

        			<h4>Prince Skyline S50E Series</h4>
        			<p>
        				The Prince Skyline S50E was introduced in 1963 and was built until 1968 in sedan (S50) and wagon (W50) 
        				bodystyles. It featured the new G1 engine, a 1.5-liter inline-4 producing 70 hp. In addition, the 1.9-liter 
        				GA4 engine with 91 hp was available. The S50 had a more boxy shape than its predecessors and introduced the 
        				four round tail lights, a Skyline feature that was kept for many generations until the R34 series and Nissan 
        				GT-R versions. It featured large round brake lights and smaller round turn-signals beside them.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The car came with two transmissions, a 3-speed column change gearbox and a more sporty 4-speed floor change 
        				gearbox. The latter version featured bucket seats to support its more sporty character, while the column shift 
        				version only had a single bench in front.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				In 1967, the S50E series was replaced by the S57 series, which came with the new G15 engine, a 1.5-liter SOHC 
        				4-cylinder with 88 hp. It was the most powerful 1.5-liter engine in Japan.
        			</p>
        			<h4>Prince Skyline 2000 GT (S54 Series)</h4>
        			<p>
        				In 1964 Prince started an attempt to go into racing. For this purpose the S50â€™s wheelbase was extended by 
        				cutting the car off in front of the firewall and adding an extra 8 inches of panel work to make a 6-cylinder 
        				engine fit in. Consequently, the 2.0-liter G7 engine from the upper class S40 Gloria model was installed to 
        				the car. In the beginning only a small number of these cars were built for GT-class racing homologation purposes, 
        				but since the car proved very popular, Prince decided to put it into full production. The resulting car was 
        				called the S54 series or the Skyline 2000 GT and came in two versions:
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The Prince Skyline 2000 GT-A used an unchanged version of the G7 engine with only a single carburetor and 105 hp. 
        				In its first race, the 1964 2nd Grand Prix of Japan, the GT-A finished 2nd and almost beat the victorious Porsche 
        				904 GTS, which was a pure race car. This was an incredible achievement considering that the Skyline was a 4-door 
        				sedan.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				Following the GT-A, the Prince Skyline 2000 GT-B was introduced in 1965. It featured a 5-speed close ratio gearbox, 
        				full instrumentation, a limited slip differential, power brakes, a 99 liter fuel tank and a high compression version 
        				of the G7 with triple 40DCOE-18 Weber carburetors and 125 hp.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				Both the GT-A and GT-B featured disc brakes with twin piston calipers up front and alloy finned drum-brakes at the rear. 
        				Later models even had flow through ventilation with small eye ball vents added to the dashboard.

        			<h4>Nissan Skyline 1500 series</h4>
        			<p>
        				The 1500 series replaced the S50 in July 1968. Including the later 1800 series, it was built until 1972. 
        				Available in 4-door sedan and wagon bodystyles, the C10 Skyline 1500 was powered by the 1,483 cc G15 engine 
        				from the previous S57 producing 94 hp and 96 lb-ft (130 Nm) of torque. The 1800 was powered by the 1,815 cc G18 
        				engine with 105 hp and 109 lb-ft (147 Nm). These cars were mostly using Prince parts and were the last Skylines 
        				to be released with the Prince badge, with all following Skylines to be renamed Nissan Skyline.
        			</p>
        			<h4>Nissan Skyline 2000 GT (GC10 series)</h4>
        			<p>
        				Just like all other derivatives of the C10 series, the GC10 (G standing for GT) was basically planned by Prince, 
        				although it was later badged Nissan Skyline 2000 GT. It was introduced in 1968 (2 months after the 1500) and first 
        				came in 4-door sedan (GC10) and 5-door wagon versions and from 1970 on also with two doors (KGC10). The car was almost
        				 the same as the preceding S54 GT-A model, featuring a 6-cylinder engine instead of the previously common 4-cylinder. 
        				 The Nissan Skyline 2000 GT got the L20 engine, a 2-liter inline-6 with 105 hp
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-X appeared in September 1971 and was powered by a L20T twin-carb engine producing 130 hp. 
        				The 2000 GT-X was available in sedan and coupe bodystyles and featured standard power windows.
        			</p>
        			<h4>The Skyline 2000 GT-R (PGC-10 series)</h4>
        			<p>
        				1968 had seen the introduction of a basic Skyline (the 1500/1800 series) and a model comparable to the previous GT-A 
        				(the GC10 series). But people were still eagerly awaiting a replacement for the GT-B. Almost a year passed after the 
        				introduction of the new model range, until finally in February 1969 the new Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-R sedan came along.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-R was powered by the 2.0l DOHC S20 engine producing 160 hp - equally strong as a Porsche 911 
        				of that time. This engine was basically the same as the GR8 of the Nissan R380 racecar, which won the 3rd GP of Japan 
        				in 1966 against a Porsche Carrera 6.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				Since it was intended for racing, the PGC10 (P stood for Prince) was very lightweight inside, without a heater or radio,
        				 but from the outside almost looked like any other 4-door sedan. After over two years, the coupe-version of the GT-R (KPGC-10) 
        				 was introduced in March 1971. A shorter wheelbase and less weight made for a better maneuverability in comparison to the 4-door 
        				 version and further enhanced this car's capability on the circuit.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-R lived up to the racing pedigree of its predecessors and the sedan scored 33 victories in those 
        				one-and-a-half years it raced, which was raised to 50 victories by the KPGC-10, until its production was stopped in 1972.

        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The two basic versions, 1600 GT and the 1800 GT, both used derivatives of the former G15 engine, 
        				the 1.6l G16 with 100 hp and the 1.8l G18 with 105 hp.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The 2000 Series was available in GT and the well-appointed GTX trims. The Nissan Skyline 2000 GT 
        				and GTX were powered by the 2.0-liter L20E engine with an output of 130 hp. After the introduction 
        				of stronger exhaust emission regulations in 1975, the engine was equipped with an electronic gasoline 
        				injection (EGI) system and the model names were changed to GT-E and GTX-E. In February 1976 it became 
        				the C111, which complied with the 1976 gas emission regulations.
        			</p>
        			<h4>Nissan Skyline GT-R (KPGC-110 series)</h4>
        			<p>
        				The most powerful of the quartet was the Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-R, using an unchanged version of the S20 engine 
        				with still 160 hp. The 1973 Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-R used disc brakes all around and in contrast to its predecessor 
        				was available as a coupe (KPGC110) only.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				With only 197 units produced, this was to be the last car to wear the GT-R badge for more than a decade.

        				The Nissan Skyline C211 series was released in August 1977 and came in sedan, coupe and station 
        				wagon bodystyles. In 1979, the front mask was revised. Due to the fuel crisis and emissions regulations, 
        				the Nissan Skyline GT-R was missing and replaced by the turbocharged 2000 GT-EX (KGC211).
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The basic versions were called 1600 TI and 1800 TI and featured the L16T with 95 hp and L18T engine with 
        				115 hp respectively, instead of the preceding "G" engines. The Nissan Skyline 2000 GT came powered by the 
        				inline-6 L20 engine producing 115 hp. The 2000 GT-EL shared its L20E engine with the former GT-X model and 
        				had 125 hp.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-EX was introduced in April 1980 and was powered by a new turbocharged-version of 
        				the L20, called the L20ET, with 145 hp. This engine might have been less powerful than the GT-R's, but in 
        				contrast to the S20 obeyed to emissions regulations and marked a new milestone in Skyline history: For the 
        				first time a turbo engine powered a Skyline.

        				With the R30 series, Nissan started to change the nomenclature of the Skyline. For the rest of the century, 
        				all Nissan Skyline generations would use the R3X designation.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				This model was publicized using the actor Paul Newman, well-known in racing circles, in a series of TV commercials. 
        				As a result, the car was affectionately called the "Newman Skyline".
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The new lineup was released in August 1981 and came in 2-door coupe, 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback bodystyles, 
        				while the wagon was dropped. Dramatically different in design from its predecessors, this new Skyline looked very 
        				boxy in shape and much more like an ordinary sedan than earlier Skylines. The round tail lights were retained, 
        				however. The coupe featured a pillarless design with roll-down quarter windows for the rear seat passengers
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The R30 marked a step back to the sporty roots of the Skyline. Earlier versions had constantly been gaining 
        				weight, which consequently slowed them down and made them less agile. This was changed with the new generation, 
        				although it was not until 1982 that a really sporty Skyline hit the road again.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				Overall, 26 versions of the R30 Nissan Skyline were available. For the basic versions, the L16 engine was 
        				dropped, so the lineup started with the 1800 TI powered by the 1.8-liter 4-cylinder Z18 with 105 hp and the 
        				2.0-liter Z20 engine in the 2000 TI. Also available for the launch of the vehicle was the 2.8l LD28 diesel 
        				with 91 hp on the 280D GT.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-E, GT-EL and GT-EX were powered by the 2-liter 6-cylinder L20E featuring an electronic 
        				fuel injection system to produce 125 hp. Among the GT-E/Xâ€™s standard features were a driverâ€™s seat with stepless 
        				adjustment, variable power steering that automatically adjusts to suit engine rpm, and a tilting/telescopic steering 
        				column. The top-of-the-line Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-ES was powered a turbocharged version of the L20E, the L20ET, with 
        				145 hp.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				In August 1983, a facelift brought new front and rear bumpers, door-mounted wing mirrors, and upgraded interiors. 
        				Four-wheel disc brakes were now standard for all models. The 4-cylinder Z18 engine was replaced by the newer CA18E with 100 hp.
        			</p>
        			<h4>Paul Newman Version</h4>
        			<p>
        				In 1983 the Paul Newman Version version was released to commemorate the association between Nissan and the actor Paul Newman. 
        				The Newman Skyline a top spec GT-ES turbo with signature embroidery and decals.
        			</p>
        			<h4>DR30 Nissan Skyline 2000 RS</h4>
        			<p>
        				After Nissan had dropped the GT-R, there had been no DOHC engine in the Skyline lineup anymore. Since the oil-crisis, 
        				the turbo had emerged, but a DOHC was still missing. The introduction of the Skyline RS was to change this condition on 
        				October 21, 1981.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The Nissan Skyline 2000 RS came in coupe and sedan bodystyles and was powered by the new FJ20E engine, a newly developed 
        				2-liter 4-cylinder high-performance engine with a 4-valve DOHC design and pent-roof combustion chamber, common on racing 
        				car engines. It delivered a maximum output of 150 hp at 6,000 rpm and 133 lb-ft (181 Nm) at 4,800 rpm. The official Nissan 
        				chassis designation for all FJ20-powered models was DR30.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				In order to distinguish the DR30 from the lesser Skyline models, Nissan made various changes to the RS-models, including the 
        				new unique front end treatment, nicknamed Tekkamen or Iron Mask by fans for its distinctive look. The headlights were considerably 
        				slimmer, and instead of a conventional grille the bonnet now sloped down to two narrow slits above a facelifted front bumper and air 
        				dam. The interior equipment was significantly upgraded to now include electric windows and air conditioning.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				In 1983 the FJ20's performance was improved by a turbo. The resulting FJ20ET (T standing for turbo) now produced 190 hp on the 
        				RS Turbo and RS-X, which was boosted to an astonishing 205 hp by the addition of an intercooler on the RS Turbo-C in 1984. This 
        				Skyline was the strongest Japanese production car of its era. An automatic transmission option was also added at this time, and 
        				changes to the "PLASMA Spark" ignition system followed in early 1985 towards the end of R30 production.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The DR30 Nissan Skyline competed in Australian Touring Car Racing and shared the 1987 Australian Manufacturer's Championship with BMW.
        			</p>
        			<h4>Nissan Skyline Super Silhouette</h4>
        			<p>
        				Races in the Super Silhouette series started in 1979. Masahiro Hasemi competed in the 1982 and 1983 seasons driving the KDR30 Nissan 
        				Skyline Super Silhouette powered by the 2,082 cc inline-4 LZ20B turbo producing 570 hp at 7,600 rpm and 398 lb-ft (539 Nm) at 6,400 rpm.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The category allowed heavy modifications and the Nissan Skyline Super Silhouette, although reminiscent of the production car on the 
        				outside, with a curb weight of 2,215 lbs. (1,005 kg) was the equivalent of a Formula racing car on the inside. After its race debut in 
        				May 1982 it did extremely well, chalking up two victories in 1982 and five victories in 1983.

						Since the R30 was very successful, Nissan did not change much of the outward appearance of its successor, 
						the R31 series. At its debut in 1985, the "Seven, as it was commonly referred to, was introduced in 4-door sedan 
						and 4-door hardtop bodystyles, the hardtop not having B-pillars. Due to the popularity of luxury cars, this Skyline 
						was aimed at the luxury department and seemed to have lost its focus on sportiness. The base model was the 1800I, 
						powered by the CA18S with 100 hp.
					</p>
        			<p>
        				But the R31 also saw the introduction of a new engine family, the RB20 engines. Available in naturally 
        				aspirated and turbo versions, the 2-liter RB20 engines produced at least 155 hp. Especially the RB20DET, 
        				a DOHC turbo with 180 hp - 210 hp stood out here as a very potent machine. It was the first in a great 
        				family of engines that would later spawn the GT-R's RB26DETT and other Skyline engines up to the R34 series.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The R31 was also produced in Australia from 1986 to 1990. Powered by the 3-liter RB30E inline-6 with 157 hp, 
        				the R31 was available in sedan or station wagon bodystyles. The wagon featured the same front style as the coupe and 
        				sedan, but did not share the four round brake lights that had been a consistent element of Skyline design. The 
        				higher-powered GTS was available only in sedan bodystyle and also came powered by the RB30E, which produced 176 hp 
        				in the GTS1 and 190 hp in the GTS2. Only 200 examples of the GTS1 were produced in 1988, all in white. The GTS that 
        				followed in 1989 was limited to 200 examples and came in red only.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				Between 1987 and 1992, R31 sedans were also manufactured in South Africa, powered by CA20S, RB20E and RB30E engines.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				From 1986, the R31 Skyline GT competed in the All Japan Championship, in which driver Aguri Suzuki won the Constructor 
        				and Driver categories.
        			</p>
        			<h4>R31 Nissan Skyline GTS</h4>
        			<p>
        				People had to wait for a two-door until the GTS hit the showrooms in May 1986. In Base form, this coupe featured the RB20DE 
        				with 155 hp, while the GTS Turbo came powered by the RB20DET with 180 hp. A GTS 4-door hardtop was available, as well.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The GTS Turbo was renamed GTS-X in 1988 when it received an improved version of the RB20DET with 190 hp. The R31 GTS-X was 
        				equipped with the HICAS (High Capacity Active Steering) all-wheel-steer system for the first time in Skyline history.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The most famous of the GTS models was the GTS-R, which was developed specifically for Group A racing. The 180 hp in the standard 
        				model may not have been bad, but were still short of the 205 hp featured in the R30 RS Turbo-C. This is why Nissan introduced the 
        				R31 Skyline GTS-R on August 21, 1987 with an RB20DET engine tuned to 210 hp thanks to a Garrett high-caliber turbocharger and 
        				stainless-steel exhaust manifold. The engine tuning was supported by an improved suspension and tuning on many other parts of the 
        				car, to give the GTS-R a sportier overall character.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				In race trim, the R31 GTS-R's 2,029 cc RB20DET-R produced over 400 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque. With only 800 built examples, 
        				the R31 Nissan Skyline GTS-R is still a highly desired car today.

        				The 1989 R32 was the resurrection of old Skyline virtues, in that each of its many versions were very sporty and balanced in 
        				handling. The R32 Nissan Skyline came in sedan and coupe bodystyles and for the first time in history, was available with 
        				rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The old engine line-up was mostly dropped and apart from the base CA18i engine, all versions - sedans and coupes - 
        				got the RB20DE engine, a normally aspirated 2-liter inline-6 with 155 hp. Stronger models like the GTS-t came with 
        				the RB20DET engine, already known from the R31 GTS Turbo, but with an increased output of 215 hp. Later versions got 
        				the normally aspirated RB25DE engine, a 2.5l DOHC inline-6 with 180 hp.
        			</p>
        			<h4>R32 Nissan Skyline GT-R</h4>
        			<p>
        				Over a decade after the last GT-R had been dropped, a new R32 Nissan Skyline GT-R finally saw the light of day in 1989. Of 
        				course, expectations for the new top-performer were high due to the heritage it could look back upon. But this new 
        				version was more than worth the GT-R badge in any way.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				At that time it may have seemed impossible for any car to resemble the PGC10â€™s success on and off the track - that was, 
        				until the new R32 GT-R came along, which soon earned the nickname Godzilla. The Skyline GT-R was available only in coupe 
        				form and featured high-tech in perfection, high-tech that in this case was used to support the driving experience, rather 
        				than hinder it.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				It came with ATTESA-ETS (Advanced Total Traction Engineering System for All - Electronic Torque Split), an electronically 
        				controlled all-wheel-drive system that usually delivers the power to the rear-wheels, but can send up to 50% of the torque 
        				to the front wheels. Thus even drifts are possible with this car, which is usually very difficult with AWD. The handling was 
        				further enhanced by Super-HICAS, an improved system of the R31 GTS-Xâ€™s all-wheel-steering, to make this car one of the best, 
        				if not THE best handling car in the world.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The R32 Nissan Skyline GT-R did not only have excellent handling characteristics, but also featured one of the best production 
        				engines of all times, the RB26DETT, a 2.6l DOHC inline-6 twin-turbo with 280 hp at 6,800 rpm and 260 lb-ft (353 Nm) at 4,400 rpm. 
        				The RB26DETT is a pure racing engine, derived directly from Group A racing, which was despecâ€™ed to fit the maximum 280 hp allowed 
        				by Japanese regulations. Tuned (newer) versions of this engine, however, have been seen to reach up to 1,300 hp, so make sure to check 
        				out the Tuning section of this site, because tuning is what the Skyline GT-R is all about. Still, the standard version makes the 0-60mph 
        				sprint in 4.8 seconds, putting it on a par with a Ferrari 355.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				But the R32 GT-R was not only a great street rocket. Designed to fit Japanese Group A racing standards, it won so many races 
        				(i.e. it 29 out of 29 races) in Group A that this class was discontinued because nobody wanted to compete with Nissan's flagship 
        				anymore.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				In Group A race-spec, the R32 Nissan Skyline GT-R featured 550 hp at 7,600 rpm and 362 lb-ft (490 Nm) at 6,000 rpm, while Group N 
        				racecars had 400 hp at 7,200 rpm and 326 lb-ft (441 Nm) at 4,800 rpm.

        				The R33 series was very similar to its predecessor, the R32 series. The GT-R was continued, as 
        				was the optional all-wheel-drive layout of the sedans and coupes. The car was still very sporty, 
        				although it had grown a little in size and weight and had thus become less agile. However, the 
        				weight disadvantage was compensated in the engine department by the new normally aspirated RB25, 
        				a 2.5l inline-6 with 190 hp for the GTS4 and GTS25 versions, and the far more powerful RB25DET, 
        				a 2.5l inline-6 turbo with an output of 245 hp, which worked in the GTS25t. Base GTS models were 
        				powered by the RB20E with 130 hp.
        			</p>
        			<h4>R33 Nissan Skyline GT-R</h4>
        			<p>
        				A heavy burden lay upon the R33 GT-R's back when it was introduced on the 1993 Tokyo Auto Show. 
        				Considering its predecessor success as an almost unbeatable race car and an excellent road car, 
        				hardly anybody could imagine the new GT-R could possibly improve on the R32â€™s performance. However, 
        				the 1995 R33 Nissan Skyline GT-R could soon prove that it was better than the old version in almost 
        				any way, although it too had gained some weight.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The R33 GT-R retained its predecessor's RB26DETT engine with an officially unchanged 280hp, but had 
        				a broader torque band which made the engine more flexible. Also standard were improved versions of 
        				ATTESA-ETS and Super-HICAS.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				Nissan took the R33 GT-R to racing, as it did with the R32 GT-R. However, in the beginning the R33 
        				was not as successful as its predecessor. In 1995 and 1996, Nissan Motorsport division NISMO took 
        				the NISMO GT-R LM to the 24 hour race of Le Mans. In 1995, the No.22 car og H. Fukuyama and S. Kasuya 
        				finished 10th overall and 5th in its class. It was modified to rear-wheel-drive and was powered by a 
        				Group N specification engine with 400hp. The following year, the No. 23 car of Hoshino, Hasemi and 
        				T.Suzuki finished 15th overall and 10th in the class with a 2.8-liter version of the RB26DETT producing 
        				600 hp.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				However, at the dawn of its life-cycle, the R33 in Pennzoil livery could secure the driver's title in 
        				the 1998 All Japan GT Championship, driven by Eric Comas and Masami Kageyama.
        			</p>
        			<h4>NISMO 400R and Nissan Skyline GT-R LM Road Car</h4>
        			<p>
        				Since engine power for production cars was restricted to 280 hp in Japan, having a car built by a tuning 
        				division was the only way to get over such a regulation. And this is exactly what Nissan did with the 
        				400R in February 1996, a car that was produced in a very limited number of only 99 pieces.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				After contending with the GT-R LM race-cars in Le Mans, the GT-R LM Road Car and the NISMO 400R were 
        				intended as road-going versions of these race cars. Both got derivatives of the Le Mans engine, the 
        				GT-R LM Road Car with 305 hp and the 400R with 400hp. Unfortunately only one GT-R LM Road Car was built 
        				to homologate the car for racing, which is confined to a museum today.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The NISMO 400R was powered by an enlarged version of the RB26DETT, the 2.8-liter RBX-GT2, a twin-turbo 
        				with an astonishing 400 hp. However, whereas the GT-R LM Road Car only got RWD (like the race-cars), 
        				the 400R got further improved GT-R technology, like ATTESA-ETS etc.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				Naturally, both carâ€™s inner potency was resembled in their designs as well. Each one of them featured 
        				bigger wheels, wider spoilers and wheel-arches and lower suspension, to give them a look even more dramatic 
        				than the already not too inconspicuous standard GT-R.
        			</p>
        			<h4>Autech Skyline GT-R 4-door</h4>
        			<p>
        				Autech is a subsidiary of Nissan specialized in modifying cars. The Autech Skyline GT-R was a four-door 
        				version of the R33 GT-R, which was introduced as a limited edition for the 40th birthday of the Nissan Skyline. 
        				The Autech version got all of the GT-Râ€™s standard technology, as well as the most vital parts of its interior 
        				like bucket seats etc. So it really was a GT-R in terms of performance - just a lot more practical.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				NISMO also produced a tuned version of the Autech GT-R, which featured the spoilers of the NISMO 400R and a 
        				380hp engine. It is not difficult to imagine that this car was THE attraction on its debut at the Tokyo Motor Show.

        				To some people the R33 series seemed a bit oversized and most of them considered the R32 to be 
        				the best Skyline ever. So Nissan changed its approach when the new R34 series was due.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The R34 line-up was oriented more towards the R32 series than towards its direct predecessor, 
        				to result in a car that was even sportier than the R33 series.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The standard R34 was available either with all-wheel-drive or rear-wheel drive, in sedan and coupe 
        				bodystyles. There were five trim levels: the R34 GT, powered by the RB20DE with 140hp; the R34 
        				25GT-V with the RB25DE engine and 193hp; the R34 25GT and 25GT-X, which get optional AWD and last 
        				but not least the top-of-the-line R34 25GT-t, powered by the RB25DET with 280hp. The GT-X and 25GT 
        				RWD models are not available in coupe bodystyles.
        			</p>
        			<h4>R34 Nissan Skyline GT-R</h4>
        			<p>
        				Regarding the technology, the R34's top version is an evolution of the former R33 GT-R, but with 
        				much sharper looks and a truly improved chassis, making this the best Skyline GT-R ever and, in 
        				comparison to other sports cars, one of the fastest cars in the world: The R34 Nissan Skyline GT-R 
        				held the Track Record for production cars at the NÃ¼rburgring Northloop, the most difficult racetrack 
        				of the world, until the Porsche 996 Turbo came along.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				Overall, six versions of the R34 GT-R were available: GT-R, GT-R V-Spec, GT-R V-Spec II, GT-R V-Spec 
        				II NÃ¼r (750 made), GT-R M-Spec and GT-R M-Spec NÃ¼r (253 made). All models share the RB26DETT inline-6 
        				with an official 280 hp. However, the NÃ¼r versions came powered by a NISMO-prepared N1 engine featuring 
        				modified a crankshaft and upgraded turbochargers. The V-Spec added additional aero parts, including a 
        				diffuser, and featured altered suspension settings. The M-Spec was name after the engineer Mizuno, who 
        				was in charge of the Skyline development team from 2000 on, and featured "Ripple Control" dampers for 
        				improved handling and heated leather seats.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The R34 Nissan Skyline GT-R was officially discontinued after 2002. However, in 2005 NISMO produced 
        				the special edition NISMO GT-R Z-Tune limited to only 20 examples. The GT-R Z-Tune started out with 
        				bodyshells of used R34 GT-R's, which were completely disassembled and refurbished. It came powered 
        				by a modified version of the RB26DETT with 500hp.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				The R34 also excelled in racing, scoring several driver's and constructor's championships in the Japan 
        				GT Championship (JGTC) between in 1999 and 2002. The JGTC race cars were powered by an upgraded version 
        				of the RB26DETT with 2,708 cc and 460 - 500 hp and weighted about 2,464 lbs. (1,200 kg). With the 1999 
        				Pennzoil Skyline GT-R, Eric Comas won the driver's championship a second time after 1998. For 2000, 
        				the GT-R placed second in both the driver's and constructor's championships. In 2001, team NISMO won 
        				the constructor's championship, with R.Michigami and H.Mitsusada scoring third in the driver's ranking.
